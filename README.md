Simple Blink Program
A basic Arduino program that blinks an LED on and off repeatedly. This repository provides a simple example of how to control an LED using Arduino.

Features:

- Turns an LED on and off repeatedly
- Adjustable blink rate
- Easy to modify and extend

Getting Started:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the code in the Arduino IDE.
3. Upload the code to your Arduino board.
4. Connect an LED to the specified pin on your Arduino board.

Components:

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- LED
- Resistor (optional)
- Breadboard and jumper wires (optional)

Usage:

- Use this code as a starting point for your own Arduino projects.
- Modify the code to suit your needs.
- Experiment with different blink rates and LED configurations.
